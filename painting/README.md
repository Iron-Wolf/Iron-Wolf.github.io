# Project structure

## Paint image naming
Paint files (in paint-img folder) are named with this convention :  
```
{b|l|s|d|c|t}_<name>[_n].png
```
- type : **B**ase, **L**ayer, **S**hade, **D**ry, **C**ontrast, **T**echnical
- name : initials of the painting's name 
- owned : tell that I have the paint (nothing) or not ("_n" is set)
  - allow me to list what i own
  - simply remove the "_n" when I own the color
